# Supervised Learning for Holberton School

#### Supervised Learning
* In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired
solutions, called labels

* A typical supervised learning task is classification. Once again we go back to the spam filter.
-- The spam filter is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham), and it needs to learn how to classify new emails.
- Another task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, by using its features.
-- Age, kilometers, brand, etc.)
> These features are called ***Predictors***.
> And this task is known as **Regression**

* For the system to be trained, you need to give it as many examples of cars, including both their predictors (characteristics) and labels (solutions).
