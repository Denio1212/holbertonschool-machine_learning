# Networks that go a little too far

> Convolutional Forward propagation
>> Convolutional forward propagation is the process by which a convolutional neural network
>> (CNN) applies a series of filters (also known as kernels) to an input to create a feature map.
>> This process is repeated for each layer in the network. The goal is to learn features from the input data that are useful for the task at hand (e.g., image classification).
