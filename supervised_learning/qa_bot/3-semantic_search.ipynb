During PLD, you will collaboratively review prior projects with a group of cohort peers.\n",

      "No laptops, tablets, or screens are allowed until all tasks have been whiteboarded and understood by the entirety of your group. This time is for whiteboarding, dialogue, and active peer collaboration. After this, you may return to computers with each other to pair or group program. \n",
      "Peer Learning Days are not about sharing solutions. This doesn't empower peers with the ability to solve problems themselves! Peer learning is when you share your thought process, whether through conversation, whiteboarding, debugging, or live coding. \n",
      "When a peer has a question, rather than offering the solution, ask the following:\n",
