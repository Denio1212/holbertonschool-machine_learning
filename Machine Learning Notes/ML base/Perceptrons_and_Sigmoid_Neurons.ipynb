    "##### Neural Models\n",
    "> A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected layers of nodes, or “neurons”, each of which takes in input, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer. The network learns from data by adjusting the weights and biases of these connections based on the error of its predictions, a process known as backpropagation. Neural networks are particularly good at tasks that involve recognizing patterns or making predictions from complex, high-dimensional data. They’re used in a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and autonomous driving."

    "> It's not a very realistic example, but it's easy to understand, and we'll soon get to more realistic examples. Suppose the weekend is coming up, and you've heard that there's going to be a cheese festival in your city. You like cheese, and are trying to decide whether or not to go to the festival. You might make your decision by weighing up three factors:\n",

But perhaps you really loathe bad weather, and there's no way you'd go to the festival if the weather is bad. You can use perceptrons to model this kind of decision-making. One way to do this is to choose a weight w1=6\n",
